  <h2>My Background</h2>
  <P>I am a financial service professional with over 10 years of experience in Operations. Through my hard work and diligence, I have been able to work for some of the top Investment Management firms on the West Coast. In my previous role as a Senior Operations Analyst, my primary duties included producing complex reporting for the investment team, creating and maintaining operational procedures, and facilitating daily trading activity. In addition to job responsibilities, I have been involved in my community and various non-profit organizations such as Jr League, United Way, and Team Kids. A little over 2 years ago, I formed a young professionals networking group in West LA that has over 2,000 members and is growing every day. I received a BS in Business Administration with a focus in Information Systems and was among the first generation to receive a college degree in my family. I am dedicated to continued personal and professional growth, reaching for my dreams, and helping others to do the same. </P>
